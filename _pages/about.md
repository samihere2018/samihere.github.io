I am a postdoctoral researcher at Southern Methodist University, working under the supervision of [Professor Daniel R. Reynolds](https://drreynolds.github.io) at Southern Methodist University.

My research interests include Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing and Mathematical Biology.

* **Numerical Methods for PDEs:** Time integration methods, temporally adaptive Multirate Infinitesimal (MRI) methods, Matched Interface and Boundary (MIB) method, Ray-Casting MIB scheme, development of boundary conditions
* **Scientific Computing:** SUNDIALS/ARKODE development, biomolecular simulations, electrostatic analysis
* **Mathematical Biology:** Implicit solvation models, mathematical methods for molecular biology, biomolecular solvation energy
