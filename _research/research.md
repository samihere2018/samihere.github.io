Research
======
My research lies at the intersection of Scientific Computing, Numerical Analysis, Mathematical Biology, and Applied Mathematics, with a particular focus on modeling complex physical phenomena using differential equations and developing efficient numerical algorithms to solve them on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms.
* **Mathematical Biology:** Implicit solvation models; Biomolecular solvation analysis; Ensemble averaged electrostatics; Mathematical methods for molecular biology; PDE modeling of molecular surface.
* **Scientific Computing:**  Electrostatic analysis; Material interface problems; Biomolecular simulations.
* **Numerical Methods for PDEs:** Matched interface and boundary (MIB) method; Alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods.
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Social dynamics modeling.
